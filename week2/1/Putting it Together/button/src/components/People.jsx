// Async will start its work, 
// but then step out of the way for the following commands to
//  continue processing without being held up by a potentially
//   slow asynchronous function. Once all other work is completed,
//   the asynchronous function can return with its own completed work.

// notice the getter and the setter are different colors:
// getter is a variable, and a setter is a function 
// the anonymous function makes it so it doesn't run automatically. it waits for the event
//  react app operates pretty much gets rid of the need for document.getElementById and querySelector. You can just synthetically inject variables into your JSX now.
